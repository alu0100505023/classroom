[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/education/classroom.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/education/classroom)

Classroom for GitHub is a [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) application designed to automate repository creation and access control, making it easy for teachers to distribute starter code and collect assignments on GitHub

## How it works

Assignments are the core of Classroom for GitHub. Teachers can easily create an assignment and distribute it to students using a private invitation URL. Optional starter code can be provided for individual or group work. It's even possible to delegate assignment creation and management to co-teachers and teaching assistants by adding them as organization administrators.
